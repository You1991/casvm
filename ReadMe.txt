We do not claim this is the most efficient implementation. If you want
to use CA-SVM as a baseline, please modify our code or rewrite the code.
For example, we commented the openmp and simd lines in our code, you may
need to uncomment these lines.

If you want to use our source code, please cite the following paper (one 
of the 4 Best papers of IPDPS 2015, which received 496 submissions):
